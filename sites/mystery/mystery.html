      <p id="message">Somebody once told me<br>
        The world is gonna roll me<br>
        I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed<br>
        She was looking kind of dumb<br>
        With her finger and her thumb<br>
        In the shape of an "L" on her forehead<br>
        
        Well, the years start coming<br>
        And they don't stop coming<br>
        Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
        Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
        Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb<br>

        So much to do, so much to see<br>
        So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
        You'll never know if you don't go<br>
        You'll never shine if you don't glow<br>


        Hey now, you're an all star<br>
        Get your game on, go play<br>
        Hey now, you're a rock star<br>
        Get the show on, get paid<br>
        And all that glitters is gold<br>
        Only shooting stars break the mold<br>

        It's a cool place and they say it gets colder<br>
        You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older<br>
        But the meteor men beg to differ<br>
        Judging by the hole in the satellite picture<br>

        The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br>
        The water's getting warm so you might as well swim<br>
        My world's on fire, how about yours?<br>
        That's the way I like it and I never get bored<br>

        Hey now, you're an all star<br>
        Get your game on, go play<br>
        Hey now, you're a rock star<br>
        Get the show on, get paid<br>
        All that glitters is gold<br>
        Only shooting stars break the mold<br>

        (Go for the moon, go, go)<br>
        (Go for the moon, go, go)<br>
        (Go for the moon)<br>
        (Go, go, go for the moon)<br>

        Hey now, you're an all star<br>
        Get your game on, go play<br>
        Hey now, you're a rock star<br>
        Get the show on, get paid<br>
        And all that glitters is gold<br>
        Only shooting stars<br>

        Somebody once asked<br>
        "Could I spare some change for gas?<br>
        I need to get myself away from this place"<br>
        I said, "Yep, what a concept<br>
        I could use a little fuel myself"<br>
        And we could all use a little change<br>

        Well, the years start coming<br>
        And they don't stop coming<br>
        Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
        Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
        Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb<br>

        So much to do, so much to see<br>
        So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
        You'll never know if you don't go (go!)<br>
        You'll never shine if you don't glow<br>

        Hey now, you're an all star<br>
        Get your game on, go play<br>
        Hey now, you're a rock star<br>
        Get the show on, get paid<br>

        And all that glitters is gold<br>
        Only shooting stars break the mold<br>
        And all that glitters is gold<br>
        Only shooting stars break the mold.</p>
